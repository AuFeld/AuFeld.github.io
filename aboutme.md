I love big data and I can not lie. 

The perfect blend of data engineering, problem solving with data structures and algorithms, humor (I love a good laugh), rabbit-holes, analytics, building a fleet of robust APIs, ETL Pipelines, and a sprinkle of passion for european football. 

Thank you for visiting.
