subtitle: Pivoting to Data Science

I love big data and I cannot lie. 

My dream job was to be a race car driver in the F1 circuit. I always imagined myself pushing the car to the edge of its capabilities to win a race while travelling the world. It seemed like an appropriate dream at the time as I was young and fearless. Like most teenagers, I didn't get behind the wheel of a car until I was 15 with a learner's permit. I was disappointed to learn that most F1 drivers start driving and competing in go karts between the ages of 7 and 12. I missed my calling, but I was still hungry to find my passion.

I gravitated towards business and earned my bachelor's degree in business management. I was fascinated by how different businesses operate and what drives a business to move forward. As a fearless self-starter, I decided to start my own business and earned my real estate license. I did well, but when I worked with real estate developers, I always felt that I was missing an edge over the competition. I realized I could gain an edge over my competition, just like in a F1 race, if I learned how to collect, process, and analyze data to accurately model financial returns for developers.

I love learning and witnessing first hand how the tech industry is disrupting the real estate market, Data Science is naturally the next step in my career. It is early in my Data Science career and almost impossible to exactly point out what kind of a Data Scientist I will become. However, my specialties include machine learning, computer programming, statisitcs, data engineering, data visualizations, and quickly learning new skills to gain an edge over my competition. 

Just like when I was young and fearless, I still imagine myself travelling the world and relocating for the next F1 race.
