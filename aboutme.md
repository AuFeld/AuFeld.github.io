I love big data and I can not lie. 

The perfect blend of data engineering, problem-solving with data structures and algorithms, laughing, going down rabbit-holes, analytics, constructing and optimizing ETL/ELT Pipelines, building a fleet of world-class APIs, team collaboration, and a dash of passion for european football. 

Thank you for visiting.
