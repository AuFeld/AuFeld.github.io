title: About Me
subtitle: Pivoting to Data Science
---

My name is Chase Goldfeld. I studied Business Management, and I've always been fascinated by how different businesses operate 
and what drives a business to move forward. I started my career on the sales side of business, and then decided to start my own business
and earned my real estate license. As a self-starter, I awlays enjoyed the challenge of building my own business. However, while
working with developers, I always felt that my impact was fairly limited. I realized that I could have a larger impact in my business 
and my career if I learned how to: collect, process, analyze, and model data for potential financial returns of a real estate transaction 
aided with data visualizations.

I love learning and witnessing first hand how tech was disrupting the real estate market, Data Science was a natural next step 
towards making a greater impact in my career. It is early in my Data Science career and almost impossible to exactly point out 
what kind of a Data Scientist I will become. If I had to choose now, I would say:

### Type A Data Scientist

The A is for Analysis. This type is primarily concerned with making sense of data or working with it in a fairly static way. 
The Type A Data Scientist is very similar to a statistician (and may be one) but knows all the practical details of working 
with data that aren’t taught in the statistics curriculum: data cleaning, methods for dealing with very large data sets, 
visualization, deep knowledge of a particular domain, writing well about data, and so on.

### Detective 

If you choose to emphasize data analysis, you can become a Detective, a master in discovering the right data and using it to 
draw conclusions. A detective is familiar with modeling and engineering methods, and uses them in a lightweight way. Analysis 
is their focus.

### Oracle

Another data scientist archetype is the Oracle, someone who has mastered the skills of modeling and the tools of machine 
learning. They will have had exposure to analysis and engineering but their focus will be on modeling—either general machine 
learning models or custom, domain specific models.
