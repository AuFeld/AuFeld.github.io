##1. Statistics
As a data scientist, I am experienced with working with tools like statistical tests, distributions, and maximum likelihood 
estimators. A good data scientist will realize what technique is a valid approach to their problem. With statistics, I can 
help stakeholders make decisions, as well as designing and evaluating experiments.

##2. Programming Skills
Good skills in tools Python and a database querying language like SQL is expected as a data scientist. 
I am comfortable carrying out different tasks of programming activities. I am capable of dealing with both 
computational and statistical aspects of it.

##3. Critical Thinkking
I can apply an objective analysis of facts to a problem. As a data scientist, I am able to abstract the paydirt of the 
problem and ignore irrelevant details.

##4. Knowledge of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses statistical methods to make computers capable of learning 
with data. For this, they shouldnâ€™t need to be explicitly programmed. With Machine Learning, things like self-driving cars, 
practical speech recognition, effective web search, and understanding of the human genome are made possible. Deep Learning 
is a part of a family of machine learning methods. It is based on learning data representations; learning can be unsupervised,
semi-supervised, or supervised.

##5. Comfort with Math
I am able to develop complex financial or operational models that are statistically relevant and can help shape key business 
strategies.

##6. Knowledge of Python

##7. Communication
Skillful communication: both verbal and written, is key. As a data scientist, I am able to use data to communicate 
effectively with stakeholders. A data scientist stands at the intersection of business, technology, and data. Qualities like 
eloquence and storytelling abilities help the scientist dilute complex technical information into something simple and 
accurate to the audience. Another task with data science is to communicate to business leaders how an algorithm arrives at a 
prediction.

##8. Data Wrangling and ETL
We have seen this with Python Data Wrangling. A lot of data I have worked with was messy: values were missing, inconsistent 
formatting with dates and strings. I am profecient in cleaning, wrangling, and building an ETL pipeline.

##9. Data Visualizations
This is an essential part of data science, more then capable of describing and communicating my findings to 
technical and non-technical audiences. Tools like Matplotlib, ggplot, or seaborn allow me to do just that. 

##10. Experience with SQL
SQL is a fourth-generation language; a domain-specific language designed to manage data stored in an RDMS 
(Relational Database Management System) and for steam processing in an RDSMS (Relational Data Stream Management System). 
I can use it to handle structured data in situations where variables of data relate to each other.
