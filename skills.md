## 1. Knowledge of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses statistical methods to make computers capable of learning 
with data. For this, they shouldnâ€™t need to be explicitly programmed. With Machine Learning, projects such as like self-driving cars, 
practical speech recognition, effective web search, and understanding of the human genome are made possible. Deep Learning 
is a part of a family of machine learning methods. It is based on learning data representations; learning can be unsupervised,
semi-supervised, or supervised.

## 2. Computer Programming 

Good skills in tools such as Python and a database querying language like SQL are expected as a data scientist. 
I am comfortable carrying out different tasks of programming activities. I am capable of dealing with both 
computational and statistical aspects of it.

## 3. Statistics and Probability

As a data scientist, I am experienced with working with tools like statistical tests, distributions, and maximum likelihood 
estimators. A good data scientist will realize what technique is a valid approach to their problem. With statistics, I can 
help stakeholders make decisions, as well as designing and evaluating experiments.

## 4. Experience with Data Management

SQL is a fourth-generation language; a domain-specific language designed to manage data stored in an RDMS 
(Relational Database Management System) and for steam processing in an RDSMS (Relational Data Stream Management System). 
I can use it to handle structured data in situations where variables of data relate to each other.

## 5. Computer Science

## 6. Data Visualizations

This is an essential part of data science, more then capable of describing and communicating my findings to 
technical and non-technical audiences. Tools like Matplotlib, Google Analytics, and Seaborn allow me to do just that.
