# What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is the process of simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. In computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal soltions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal structure.

# Why should be care about Dynamic Programming?

Optimization. Sometimes, executing recursion can involve repetitive computations and require a lot of resources and time to compute, like O(2<sup>n</sup>) long
